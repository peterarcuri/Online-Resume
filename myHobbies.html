<h1><u>My Hobbies</u></h1>

<h2>Cooking</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Being able to create a dish you can call your own, is a wonderful, joyful experience</li>
    </ul>
<hr />

<h2>Playing Music</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Playing music has not only been a passion of mine since an early age, but<br>
    fortunate enough to make a living doing it. One of my greatest loves of all time!</li>
</ul>
<hr />

<h2>Movies</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Call me old-fashion, but nothing quite like the experience of seeing a blockbuster film<br>
        on the big screen. In addition, a wonderful time spent with my son</li>
</ul>

<h2>Coding</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Not only is this a journey towards a new career, but it's also quite<br>
    enjoyable building & breaking code to see the end result</li>
</ul>
